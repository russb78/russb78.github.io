  Hello! I'm Russell and I'm the editor of Linux User and Developer magazine...
</p>

I've been a computer & technology writer for over 15 years and started entirely by accident.

While working as the manager of a *GAME* store in the south of England I was approached by a regular customer who was an editor for a local publishing firm. My first gig was writing solutions for PC games that were contracted to a publisher in Italy.

Being paid to play games like *Little Big Adventure* seemed like a dream come true at the time. Anyone who's written solutions will know that to be to the contrary. Some time later the publisher launched a Dreamcast magazine for which I was the editor. It was utterly terrible and tanked much in line with Sega's fortunes. 

After a few years with the ill-fated publisher and a further six years working as a freelance writer for various computer and technology mags, zines and sites I took an editor position at [*Imagine Publishing Ltd*](http://www.imaginepublishing.co.uk) in 2007. After stints editing magazines about Xbox 360 and PC gaming, I became editor of [*Linux User & Developer*](http://www.linuxuser.co.uk) just before Christmas 2009.

You can follow *Linux User* on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/linuxusermag) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/LinuxUserUK) if you're so inclined.

I love Linux, open source, hacking and making pet projects with a small army of [Raspberry Pis](http://www.raspberrypi.org) and [Arduinos](http://www.arduino.cc).

You can find a small sample of my projects on my [Github page](http://github.com/russb78). 

Thanks for reading!
