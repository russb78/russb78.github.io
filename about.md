  Hello! I'm Russell and I'm the editor of Linux User and Developer magazine...
</p>

I've been a computer & technology writer for over 15 years. 

While working as the manager of a *GAME* store in the south of England circa 1998 I was approached by a regular customer who was an editor for a local publishing firm. Soon after I was writing solutions for PC games that were contracted to a publisher in Italy.

Being paid to play games like *Little Big Adventure* seemed like a dream come true at the time. Anyone who's written solutions will testify to the contrary. Some time later the publisher launched a Dreamcast magazine for which I became the editor. It was utterly terrible and tanked much in line with Sega's hardware fortunes. 

After a few years with this ill-fated publisher and a further six years working as a freelance writer for various computer and technology mags, zines and sites I took an editor position at [*Imagine Publishing Ltd*](http://www.imaginepublishing.co.uk) in 2007. After stints editing X-360 and Total PC Gaming, I became editor of [*Linux User & Developer*](http://www.linuxuser.co.uk) just before Christmas 2009.

While I had previously been using open source software to write about largely proprietary creations, I now write about open source creations on largely proprietary software.

Linux User is consistently the UK's best selling Linux and open source magazine and is very popular throughout Europe, America, Australia and India. 

The magazine supports open source, educational and charitable organisations via free advertising campaigns. These include [LibreOffice](http://libreoffice.org), [Code Club](www.codeclub.org.uk) and [Computer Aid International](http://www.computeraid.org).

You can follow *Linux User* on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/linuxusermag) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/LinuxUserUK).

I love Linux, open source, hacking and making. I live in Bournemouth with a small army of [Raspberry Pis](http://www.raspberrypi.org) and [Arduinos](http://www.arduino.cc).
