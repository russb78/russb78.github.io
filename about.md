  Hello! I'm Russell and I'm currently the editor of Linux User and Developer magazine...
</p>

I've been a computer & technology writer since leaving school.

I started entirely by accident. While working as the manager of a *GAME* store in the south of England I was approached by a regular customer who was an editor for a local publishing firm. My first gig was writing solutions for PC games. Being paid to play Dungeon Keeper and Little Big Adventure seemed like a dream come true. Anyone who's written solutions will know that to be to the contrary. Some time after the publisher launched a Dreamcast magazine for which I was the editor. It was utterly terrible and tanked much in line with Sega's fortunes.

After spending a few years with the ill-fated publisher, then spending six years as a freelance writing for various mags, zines and sites I took an editor position at [*Imagine Publishing Ltd.*](www.imaginepublishing.co.uk) in 2007. After stints writing about Xbox 360 and PC gaming, I became editor of [*Linux User & Developer*](www.linuxuser.co.uk) just before Christmas 2009.

You can follow *Linux User* on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/linuxusermag) and [Facebook](www.facebook.com/LinuxUserUK) if you're so inclined. 

I love Linux, open source, hacking and making pet projects with a small army of [Raspberry Pis](www.raspberrypi.org) and [Arduinos](www.arduino.cc).

You can find a small sample of my projects on my [Github page](www.github.com/russb78). 

Thanks for reading!
