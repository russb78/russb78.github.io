  Hello! I'm Russell and I'm the editor of Linux User and Developer magazine...
</p>

I've been a computer & technology writer for over 15 years. 

I walked into it entirely by accident. While working as the manager of a *GAME* store in the south of England circa 1998 I was approached by a regular customer who was an editor for a local publishing firm. Soon after I was writing solutions for PC games that were contracted to a publisher in Italy and writing reviews for a small UK PlayStation magazine.

Being paid to play games seemed like a dream come true. Anyone who's done it for any length of time will testify to the contrary. Some time later the publisher launched a Dreamcast magazine for which I became the editor. It was terrible and failed much in line with Sega's hardware fortunes. 

After a few years with this ill-fated publisher (the MD was affectionately titled 'Bomber Harris'), I set out on my own as a freelance computer and technology writer. I wrote for Dennis Publishing, Future Publishing, Trinity Mirror among others. Anything from small blog posts to fill the weekend quota to cover features for international magazines. I wrote about the advent of *BitTorrent*, interviewed *Intel's* Paul Otellini when *Centrino* was a thing and their Tick-Tock model was born. 

In 2007 I took an editor role at [*Imagine Publishing Ltd*](http://www.imaginepublishing.co.uk). After stints editing the UK's best selling independent Xbox 360 magazine and launching the first PC gaming magazine in over a decade, I became editor of [*Linux User & Developer*](http://www.linuxuser.co.uk) just before Christmas 2009.

While I had previously been using open source software to write about largely proprietary creations, I now write about open source creations on largely proprietary software. It's a funny old game.

Despite the brand lying dormant for a few years before *Imagine* acquired it in 2009, *Linux User* is now consistently the UK's best selling Linux and open source magazine and sells well throughout Europe, America and Australia. 

The magazine supports open source, educational and charitable organisations via free advertising campaigns. These include [*LibreOffice*](http://libreoffice.org), [*Code Club*](www.codeclub.org.uk) and [*Computer Aid International*](http://www.computeraid.org).

Suffice it to say I love Linux, open source, hacking and making. I live in Bournemouth with a small army of [Raspberry Pis](http://www.raspberrypi.org) and [Arduinos](http://www.arduino.cc), much to the chagrin of my fianc√© Rebecca.
