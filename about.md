  Hello! I'm Russell and I'm the editor of Linux User and Developer magazine...

I've been a computer & technology writer for over 15 years. 

I walked into it entirely by accident. While working as the manager of a *GAME* store in the south of England circa 1998 I was approached by a regular customer who was an editor for a local publishing firm. Soon after I was writing solutions for PC games that were contracted to a publisher in Italy and writing reviews for a small UK PlayStation magazine.

Being paid to play games all day seemed like a dream come true and a cushy little number. Anyone who's actually done it for any length of time will testify to the contrary. Some time later the publisher launched a Dreamcast magazine for which I became the editor. It was, to be frank, terrible and flopped much like Sega's hardware fortunes.

After a few years, I set out on my own as a self-employed computer and technology writer. I freelanced for Dennis Publishing, Future Publishing and Trinity Mirror among others. Anything from small blog posts to fill the weekend quota to cover features for shiny magazines. I wrote about the advent of *BitTorrent*, interviewed *Intel's* Paul Otellini and wrote one of the first guides about wireless home networks. 

In 2007 I took an editor role at [*Imagine Publishing Ltd*](http://www.imaginepublishing.co.uk). After stints editing the UK's best selling independent Xbox 360 magazine and the first PC gaming magazine launched in over a decade, I became editor of [*Linux User & Developer*](http://www.linuxuser.co.uk) at the end of 2009.

Despite the brand being dormant for a few years before *Imagine* acquired it, *Linux User* is now consistently the UK's best selling Linux and open source magazine and performs well throughout Europe, America and Australia.

Since taking over, the magazine supports open source, educational and charitable organisations via free advertising campaigns. These include [*LibreOffice*](http://libreoffice.org), [*Code Club*](www.codeclub.org.uk) and [*Computer Aid International*](http://www.computeraid.org).

You can follow *Linux User* on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/linuxusermag) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/LinuxUserUK).

While as I freelance writer I'd been using open source software to write about proprietary creations, I now find myself writing about open source creations on largely proprietary software. It's a funny old game.

Suffice it to say I love Linux, open source, hacking and making. 
I live in Bournemouth with a small army of [Raspberry Pis](http://www.raspberrypi.org) and [Arduinos](http://www.arduino.cc), much to the chagrin of my fianc√© Rebecca.
