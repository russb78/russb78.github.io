  Hello! I'm Russell and I'm the editor of Linux User and Developer magazine...
</p>

![Russell Barnes](/assets/Russell_twitter.jpg "Watch where you point that thing")

I've been a computer & technology writer for over 15 years. 

Before I was the editor of *Linux User & Developer* I was a freelance computer and technology writer. I freelanced for Dennis Publishing, Future Publishing and Trinity Mirror among others and did everything from small blog posts to cover features for shiny magazines. I wrote about the advent of *BitTorrent*, interviewed *Intel's* Paul Otellini and put together one of the first guides about affordable wireless home networks.

In 2007 I took an editor role at [*Imagine Publishing Ltd*](http://www.imaginepublishing.co.uk). After stints editing the UK's best selling independent Xbox 360 magazine and the first PC gaming magazine launched in over a decade (Total PC Gaming), I became editor of [*Linux User & Developer*](http://www.linuxuser.co.uk) at the end of 2009.

Despite the brand being dormant for a few years before *Imagine* acquired it, *Linux User* is now consistently the UK's best selling Linux and open source magazine and performs well throughout Europe, America and Australia.

Since taking over the magazine I initiated a program to support open source, educational and charitable organisations with free advertising campaigns. These include [*LibreOffice*](http://libreoffice.org), [*Code Club*](www.codeclub.org.uk) and [*Computer Aid International*](http://www.computeraid.org).

You can follow *Linux User* on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/linuxusermag) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/LinuxUserUK).

Suffice it to say I love Linux, open source, hacking and making. 
I live in Bournemouth with a small army of [Raspberry Pis](http://www.raspberrypi.org) and [Arduinos](http://www.arduino.cc), much to the chagrin of my fianc√© Rebecca.
