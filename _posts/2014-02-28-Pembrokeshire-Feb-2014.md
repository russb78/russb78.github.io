Rebecca and I often come to St. Davids on the Pembrokeshire coast for a long weekend. Rebecca's family own a lovely a little cottage just off the cliffs. 

It's probably one of the most beautiful parts of the UK. It also boasts some of the darkest skies, most impressive coastline and cleanest beaches you'll see.

It also offers some of incredible traditional architecture. Every corner your turn into is another postcard. If I get the chance I'll put together some of my favourite pictures from the last few years.

This is one of my favourites, not least because it's taken next door to the cottage.

Sadly Mr Griffith is no longer with us. As far as I know the house is going to the National Trust. This shot was from 2008 - it's in a terrible state at the moment and in danger of falling down.

The top of a tall hill directly behind the cottage leads straight to the cliff top. The coastal paths here are completely breathtaking. Wild horses, otters, seal pups and rare birds are everywhere.
