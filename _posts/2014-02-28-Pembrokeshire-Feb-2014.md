Rebecca and I often visit St. David's on the Pembrokeshire coast for a long weekend. Rebecca's family own a lovely a little cottage just shy of the cliffs in a tiny hamlet called Treleddyd-fawr. 

It's probably one of the most beautiful parts of the UK. It also boasts some of the darkest skies, most impressive coastline and cleanest beaches you'll see.

It also offers some of incredible traditional architecture. Every corner is another postcard. If I get the chance I'll put together some of my favourite pictures from the last few years.

The following shots is one of my favourites, not least because it's taken next door to the cottage. It belonged to Mr Griffiths. A real character from all accounts, but I never actually met him.

Sadly Mr Griffiths is no longer with us. As far as I know the house is going to the National Trust. This shot was from 2008 - it's in a terrible state these days and in danger of falling down.

The top of a tall hill directly behind the cottage leads straight to the cliff top. The coastal paths here are completely breathtaking. You'd never spend more than a few minutes without seeing some combination of wild horses, otters, seals or rare birds.

A short drive away is St. David's RLNI Lifeboat Station. Commercial boat trips also set off from here and require you to walk the steel ramp leading into the water. That's Rebecca at the bottom of the shot.
